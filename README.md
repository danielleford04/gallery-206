# Gallery 206

This project leverages the Metropolitan Museum of NY's API to display art from the museums Asian Department, many of which is found in their Gallery 206.

Note: Their API only allows 80 calls per minute, and each "page" of items involves 6-7 calls, so if you refresh frequently or quickly go through multiple pages, you may get an error and need to wait and refresh.
